# Machine Learning -  MNIST Dataset

It's a machine learning example made with a [Deep Feedfoward Neural Network](https://github.com/JBezerra/deep-Feedfoward-Neural-Network/) using [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

## Usage

**Train New Model**: Train a model from zero and watch it learn with the images.  You can also predict while it's learning.

**Load Trained Model**: Load a model already trained and have fun with the predictions.

**Predict Number or Spacebar**: Predict number with the test data and see the prediction in the top of the screen.

**Stop Training**: Stop the training of your model.

**Continue Training**: Continue the training of your model.

## How it works?

The [Neural Network](https://github.com/JBezerra/deep-Feedfoward-Neural-Network/) it's fed with the images of MNIST and try to guess which number is it.\
\
For every error that it does, it tries to correct itself to come the closest as possible of the real output, in our case, the digit.\
\
After some training, the [Neural Network](https://github.com/JBezerra/deep-Feedfoward-Neural-Network/) learns how identify the human digits by itself, and predict the result with high accuracy. The results could be seen in the right-side of the screen, and you can play around with it =D
